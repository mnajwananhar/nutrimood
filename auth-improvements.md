# Authentication Improvements for NutriMood

## Overview

This document outlines the authentication improvements made to the NutriMood application to address persistent issues with login state maintenance, especially during page refreshes.

## Key Components Added

### 1. Session Manager (`src/lib/session-manager.js`)

A centralized session management system that:

- Monitors session validity proactively
- Refreshes tokens automatically before expiration
- Synchronizes authentication state across components
- Provides resilient error recovery

### 2. Session Initializer (`src/components/SessionInitializer.js`)

A component that initializes the session manager early in the application lifecycle.

### 3. Authentication Hook (`src/lib/useAuth.js`)

A custom React hook that:

- Centralizes authentication logic for consistent behavior
- Handles redirects consistently
- Supports automatic session refreshes
- Provides error recovery mechanisms
- Offers simple integration with components

## Key Enhancements

### Supabase Integration

- Added proactive token refresh mechanism
- Improved error handling with fallback options
- Enhanced caching with proper invalidation
- Added detailed logging with "[AUTH DEBUG]" prefix

### Authentication State Management

- Improved synchronization between browser storage and memory
- Added resilient recovery paths for network errors
- Enhanced event handling for auth state changes
- Implemented a multi-layered caching approach

### UI Responsiveness

- Reduced "jumping" of UI elements during auth state changes
- Better loading state management
- Improved error handling for better user experience
- Consistent behavior across page refreshes

## Implementation Details

### Session Lifecycle

1. **Initialization**:

   - `SessionInitializer` initializes `SessionManager` on app load
   - `SessionManager` checks current session validity

2. **Session Monitoring**:

   - Periodic checks verify token validity
   - Proactive refresh happens before token expiration
   - Window focus events trigger session validation

3. **Error Recovery**:
   - Multiple fallback paths for authentication errors
   - Graceful degradation with cached data
   - Automatic retries with refreshed tokens

### Storage Strategy

- **Memory Cache**: Primary for performance
- **SessionStorage**: Quick flags for specific states
- **LocalStorage**: Persistent fallback for longer sessions
- **Supabase Session**: Source of truth with automatic refresh

## Usage Examples

### Basic Protected Component

```javascript
"use client";

import { useAuth } from "@/lib/useAuth";

export default function ProtectedPage() {
  const { user, loading } = useAuth();

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome, {user.email}</h1>
      <p>Your protected content here</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Login Page

```javascript
"use client";

import { useAuth } from "@/lib/useAuth";

export default function LoginPage() {
  const { loading } = useAuth({
    redirectIfFound: true,
    redirectTo: "/dashboard",
  });

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Login Form</h1>
      {/* Login form components */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Basic Auth Flow**: Login, navigate between pages, verify auth state persists
2. **Refresh Scenarios**: Refresh the page on dashboard and verify auth state is maintained
3. **Session Expiry**: Test behavior when session expires
4. **Network Issues**: Test behavior with intermittent network connection
5. **Multiple Tabs**: Test behavior with multiple tabs open
6. **Focus/Blur**: Test behavior when switching between browser tabs/applications

## Conclusion

These improvements provide a more robust authentication system that should eliminate the issues with login state not being properly maintained during page refreshes. The system now has multiple layers of resilience and recovery paths to ensure a consistent user experience.
